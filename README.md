Weather API homework

## Background
Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. So let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Now, we know what you may be thinking: "Duh. It gets hotter..."

But, if pressed, how would you prove it?

## Part I - WeatherPy
Contained in this analysis done with jupyter notebook: 

* Over 500 randomly selected (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude.

* A weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls.

* A print log of each city as it's being processed with the city number and city name.

* Saved CSV file of all retrieved data and a PNG images for each scatter plot.

* A series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

      Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
